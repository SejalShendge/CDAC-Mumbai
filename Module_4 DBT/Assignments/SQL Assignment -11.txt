Subqueries.

1) Write a query that uses a subquery to obtain all orders for the customer named Cisneros. 
Assume you do not know his customer number (cnum).
SELECT * FROM ORDERS 
WHERE Cnum = (SELECT Cnum FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE Cname = 'Cisneros');
2) Write a query that produces the names and ratings of all customers who have above-average 
orders. 
SELECT Cname, Rating 
FROM CUSTOMERS 
WHERE Cnum IN (SELECT Cnum FROM ORDERS GROUP BY Cnum HAVING SUM(Amt) > (SELECT 
AVG(Amt) FROM ORDERS));
3) Write a query that selects the total amount in orders for each salesperson for whom this total is 
greater than the amount of the largest order in the table.
SELECT Snum, SUM(Amt) AS TotalOrders 
FROM ORDERS 
GROUP BY Snum 
HAVING TotalOrders > (SELECT MAX(Amt) FROM ORDERS);
