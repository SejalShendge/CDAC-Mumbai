Assignment – 13 Using the UNION clause


1) Create a union of two queries that shows the names, cities, and ratings of all customers. Those 
with rating of 200 or greater will also have the words “High Rating”, while the others will have 
the words “Low Rating”. 
SELECT Cname, City, Rating, 'High Rating' AS Status FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE Rating >= 200
UNION
SELECT Cname, City, Rating, 'Low Rating' AS Status FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE Rating < 200;

2) Write a command that produces the name and number of each salesperson and each customer 
with more than one current order. Put the results in alphabetical order. 
SELECT Sname, Snum FROM SALESPEOPLE WHERE Snum IN (SELECT Snum FROM ORDERS GROUP BY 
Snum HAVING COUNT(*) > 1)
UNION
SELECT Cname, Cnum FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE Cnum IN (SELECT Cnum FROM ORDERS GROUP BY 
Cnum HAVING COUNT(*) > 1)
ORDER BY Sname, Cname;


3) Form a union of three queries. Have the first select the snums of all salespeople in San Jose; the 
second, the cnums of all customers in San Jose; and the third the onums of all orders on October 3. 
Retain duplicates between the last two queries but eliminate any redundancies between either of 
them and the first. (Note: in the sample tables as given, there would be no such redundancy. This is 
besides the point.)
SELECT Snum FROM SALESPEOPLE WHERE City = 'San Jose'
UNION
SELECT Cnum FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE City = 'San Jose'
UNION ALL
SELECT Onum FROM ORDERS WHERE Odate = '1990-10-03';
